===============

To communicate between a webview and a parent app, you need to have JavaScript on both sides.  The hosted file speaks up to the parent app through a becon, and passes callbacks which the parent then executes.  The parent js file exectures code in the hosted app that often fires events the hosted app responds to.
# JS files for both hosted app (your web app) and the client (your windows 8 app)
# sample project that already has the code added in.
